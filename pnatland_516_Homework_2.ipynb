    "\n",
    "This project was inspired by an actual event that was experienced by a UMSI student.  This student was applying for a \n",
    "job with a large multi-national corporation (let's call it XYZ, Inc.).  XYZ Inc. was looking for someone who could \n",
    "conduct an analysis of a massive (terabyte-size) text dataset.  They had heard about Spark and planned on investigating it but hadn't yet found someone internally who had the skillset required to tackle the problem.  The UMSI student indicated that they had experience with Spark and could likely handle the task.  The hiring supervisor then provided a non-Spark script and asked the student to demonstrate how that script could be translated to work in a Spark environment.  The student was able to do the conversion and, pending completion of their degree, will have secured a job at XYZ, Inc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment simulates that exact situation.  In this assignment you will take a python-based script that does\n",
    "part-of-speech tagging on a large dataset and convert it, as much as possible, to use a pyspark-based approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original script was written by Luke Petschauer and a forked version is available at https://github.com/umsi-data-science/NP_chunking_with_nltk/blob/master/NP_chunking_with_the_NLTK.ipynb. That page provides a detailed explanation of the original code and an excellent overview and justification for the use of\n",
    "part-of-speech tagging.  The code from the \"Final Code\" section is reproduced in the first code cell below, which you should run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run and study that cell and review https://github.com/umsi-data-science/NP_chunking_with_nltk/blob/master/NP_chunking_with_the_NLTK.ipynb.  \n",
    "You will be taking a similar approach to analyze news articles from the New York Times using pyspark.  There are two tasks (Task 1 and Task 2) to complete below.\n",
    "**You should create and use a short dataset, based on a small fraction of the complete\n",
    "dataset in your development work, and then when you're happy with your code run it on the complete dataset.**\n",
    "The complete analysis should take about 10 minutes to complete."
